/*  Example sketch for the PCF8574 for the purposes of showing how to use the interrupt-pin.

    Attach the positive lead of an LED to PIN7 on the PCF8574 and the negative lead to GND,
    a wire from GPIO2 (Nodemcu D4) to PIN3 that will be used to trigger the interrupt,
    and the INT-pin to GPIO14 (Nodemcu D5) on the ESP8266.

    If all goes well you should see the small blue LED on the ESP-module lighting up and the
    LED connected to the PCF going off, and vice versa. */

/*  Wire.h already defines "Wire" which the PCF8574-class would use by default,
    but for the sakes of an example let's define our own instance of it and use that instead!

    Also, since I2C is emulated on the ESP8266 let's redefine what pins to use as SDA and SCL
    and instead swap them around!
    DO NOT FORGET TO WIRE ACCORDINGLY, SDA GOES TO GPIO5, SCL TO GPIO4 (ON NODEMCU GPIO5 IS D1 AND GPIO4 IS D2) */
